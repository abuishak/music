<p>O'Mally's--Sam O'Mally Sr. opened the store in 1955.  The original store was located on the corner of 17th and Jones Street.  Sam Sr. was an amazing musician.  His instrument of choice was the acoustic guitar and he spent many hours entertaining the music store customers.  He frequently played at area clubs to a faithful following.  The store expanded in 1972 and moved to the current location at 165 Avenue B.  Once in their new location, they had a much larger selection of band equipment, both new and used instruments.  Sam Jr. joined the family business in 1980 and is now the owner/manager.  Sam Sr. retired in 1985.  Sam Jr. had carried in the business in a way that would make Sam Sr. proud." </p>
